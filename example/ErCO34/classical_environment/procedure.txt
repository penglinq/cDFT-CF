Files to prepare:
- <geometry>.vasp: the unit cell in the format of a VASP POSCAR
- <geometry>_1mole.xyz: the molecular cluster that will be treated quantum mechanically
- VASP run files. Put under k111 folder.

Procedures:
1. Perform VASP gamma-point calculation in the folder "k111" with PBE functional
2. Perform Bader charge analysis by first running:
   chgsum.pl AECCAR0 AECCAR2
   and then running:
   bader CHGCAR -ref CHGCAR_sum
   This will generate the file ACF.dat that contains the number of electrons on each atom ("CHARGE").
3. Edit the "User input" section of gen_input.py and run 
4. Edit the "User input" section of the two gpu_compute_ewald_pot*.py and run both
